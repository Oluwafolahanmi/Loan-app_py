This Python script establishes a cooperative management system with MySQL integration. It offers functionalities for both registered members and non-members, enabling registration, login, and various financial transactions. Members can deposit money, take loans, repay loans, and check their account balances. Non-members have limited options, primarily focused on loan-related activities. The script implements basic authentication, error handling, and business logic such as applying interest rates on loans and deposits. Additionally, it interacts with a MySQL database to store member details, loan information, and administrative data.
